h1. EMF GenModel Bug

Just a reminder that EPackage in @.ecore@ file is different than the genmodel-generated Java EPackage.

do NOT load EPackage from .ecore file, because the EClassifier index number would be different
than the actual genmodel-generated .java

so we use Class.forName instead to get the generated EPackage class, then get the eINSTANCE
from there
